description: Everything you need to build your own blinqr device from scratch.
---

This section contains all the resources you need to build your own blinqr reminder box, including parts lists, wiring diagrams, 3D printable enclosure files, and step-by-step assembly instructions.

## Build Overview

Building a blinqr device involves four main steps:

1. **[Bill of Materials](/build/bom/)** - Gather all the components you'll need
2. **[Wiring Guide](/build/wiring/)** - Connect the electronics according to the wiring diagram
3. **[3D Printing](/build/3d-printing/)** - Print the enclosure and button caps
4. **[Assembly](/build/assembly/)** - Put it all together

## Difficulty Level

| Aspect | Difficulty | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Electronics | Beginner | Basic soldering, through-hole components |
| 3D Printing | Beginner | No supports needed, standard settings |
| Assembly | Beginner | Snap-fit design, minimal tools required |
| Firmware | Intermediate | Requires PlatformIO and USB cable |

## Time Estimate

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Ordering parts | 1-2 weeks (shipping) |
| 3D printing | 4-6 hours |
| Wiring/soldering | 1-2 hours |
| Assembly | 30 minutes |
| Firmware flashing | 15 minutes |
| **Total** | **~6-8 hours active work** |

## Tools Required

- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire strippers/cutters
- Small Phillips screwdriver
- 3D printer (or access to one)
- USB cable for programming
- Multimeter (optional, for troubleshooting)

## Before You Start

1. Read through all the documentation first
2. Verify you have all components from the [BOM](/build/bom/)
3. Test your ESP32 board before soldering
4. Print a test piece to verify your printer settings
